#: description: Charged-particle pseudorapidity density for ten centrality classes over a broad $\eta$ range in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=5.02\,\mathrm{TeV}$. Boxes around the points reflect the total uncorrelated systematic uncertainties, while the filled squares on the right reflect the correlated systematic uncertainty (evaluated at $\eta=0$). Statistical errors are generally insignificant and smaller than the markers.  Also shown is the reflection of the $3.5<\eta<5$ values around $\eta=0$ (open circles).  The line corresponds to fits of the difference between two Gaussians centred at $\eta=0$ ($f_{\text{GG}}$) [PLB754.373] to the data.
